Function Plotter is a Java-based tool for graphing mathematical functions like polynomials, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and step functions. It features a dynamic GUI that supports plotting one or two functions, marking intersections, shading area between curves, and detecting extrema and inflection points. The plot supports zooming, panning, and SVG export, with clean axis markings from 1 to 200. Built using Java Swing and a custom parser, the project is modular and includes all dependencies in the lib/ folder
